"""Parse a BibTeX library and look up records by PDF filename.

Used by ``process_corpus.py`` when the user supplies ``--bib path/to/lib.bib``
to skip Grobid's header parser for any record whose ``file = {Foo.pdf}``
field matches an input PDF. References inside each PDF are still extracted
by Grobid; only the bibliographic *header* metadata (title, authors, year,
journal, DOI, abstract) is overridden.

The parser is intentionally minimal — it handles the subset of BibTeX
that machine-generated bibliographies emit: ``@type{key, field =
{value}, ...}`` with balanced-brace values. It is not a full bibtex
parser; entries that use ``"..."`` quoting or ``@string`` macros are
best-effort.
